# Brand-Sentiment-Analysis
Using factor analysis to analyse trends and patterns in different brands.

In marketing research an attitude may be measured from different directions using different
variables. One may group similar variables into factors by creating a new factor or variable based on more
than one question and such technique is termed analysis of interdependence. This model provides insights on customer sentiment towards 10 anonymised brands.

The sentiment categories were performance, market leadership, latest, fun, serious, bargain, value. 1000 customers completed the survey. 3-factor and 2-factor analysis was conducted after following the Scree plot criteria (3) and latent root factor criteria (2).
